## Learning Goals
<details>
 This project allowed me to put into practice various programming skills covered in the first module of the bootcamp. Through this game, I combined DOM and Canvas manipulation with integrating multiple screens, buttons, movement, and objects, making this project a culmination of what I've learned so far.

## Introduction
This game is a JavaScript-based adaptation of the classic Plants vs. Zombies, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to protect your house from invading zombies by planting various defensive plants in your backyard. Each plant type has unique abilities to help you keep the zombies at bay. The game involves strategic planting, resource management, and quick responses to prevent zombies from reaching your house.

## How to Play

- **Choose a Plant**: Click on the plant card of your choice. Each plant costs a certain number of suns.

- **Place Your Plant**: Click on an empty spot in the backyard to plant it. You cannot plant in a spot that is already occupied or if you lack enough suns.

- **Collect Suns**: Suns are only produced with the Sunflowers, so plant some right at the start or you will run out of Suns. 

- **Stop the Zombies**: Don't let the zombies get to the house or they'll eat your brains!! Maybe that's not a problem for you, but you will lose the game. 


## Scalability
This project is designed with future expansion in mind. Possible improvements include:

- **New Plants and Zombies**: Add more plant and zombie types with different attributes like attack range, strength, and special abilities.
- **Game Statistics**: Display stats, such as the total zombies defeated, suns collected, and more on the Victory screen.
- **Advanced Levels and Game Modes**: Introduce difficulty levels, night mode, and survival or infinite modes for a more challenging experience.
